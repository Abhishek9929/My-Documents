HOW TO ACCESS EC2 INSTANCE EVEN IF PEM FILE IS LOST

Accessing the EC2 instance even if you loose the pem file is rather easy.

First, create a new instance by creating new access file, call it 'helper' instance with same region and VPC as of the lost pem file instance.

Now stop the lost pem file instance. Remember not to terminate instance but to stop it.

Go to EBS volumes, select the root volume of the lost pem file instance and detach.

Now again select the detached volume and this time you have to attach this volume to helper instance which we created before. Since helper instance already has a root volume by default as /dev/sda1, the newly attached volume will be secondary(eg: /dev/sdf).

Login to your helper instance with its pem file.

Execute below commands:

sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt
sudo cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /mnt/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo umount /mnt
* when you will attached the volume 2nd time to the original instance at that timme make root volume by default as /dev/sda1.

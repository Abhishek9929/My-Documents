EBS(Elastic block storage) AND EFS(Elastic file system)
---------------------*---------------------------------
EC2 instances support two types for block level storage
Elastic Block Store - EBS (Persistent - Network attached drives)
Instance Store ( Ephemeral/temporary store)

Elastic BLOCK STORAGE:
             -Persistant volume that means data can be shared or backed up
	         - this is network atttach volume
	         - this volume is aws recommmened volume
instance storage :
             -Not Persistant volume that means data can not be shared or backed up
	         - physical attached storage
	        - AWS does not recomend to use in instance.it can be used for testing
--------------------------------------------------------			 
Instance Store           Elastic Block Store
----------------------------------------------------
Local to Instance     |    Network Attached Storage
Non-persistent storage|     Persistent Storage
No Snapshot Support   |    Point in time Snapshot support

Elastic block storage also classified into
     -Root volume
	       > Root volume is the primary storage
		   > Any instance you want to lunch root volume is must
		   > Your AMI(OS) is insatalled on Root Volume
           > You can have only one root Volume for an instance
	 -Additional volume
	       > Apart from root Volume, you can have Additional Volumes attached to your instance, like "D" drive
           > Additional Volumes are OPTIONAL
		   > You can have multiple Additional Volumes for an instance
> Volume Types :
     > SSD - Best performance, types
	 > HDD - Typical hard drives
	 > Previous Generation - Not looking for performance, less cost

> Rules :
     > An Volume is locked to an Availability Zone
	   Ex : I have an instance provisioned in "1A" Availability Zone, and my Volume is provisioned in "1B" Availability Zone, then you can never attach Volume 			to the instance 	
     > A Volume can only be attached to One Instance at a time i.e You can't share a Volume across multiple instances at the same time  
	          > NOTE : Expection for Nitro Instances
> Backups 
    	> EBS Volumes can be backed up into SNAPSHOTS	
		> Using SNAPSHOTS
		    > We can Share the data across instances, which are in different Availability Zones
			> We can Share the ata across instances, which are in different REGIONS
			> We can backup data, for disaster recovery
        > SNAPSHOTS are in-active data, meaning you cannot attach SNAPSHOTS to your instances
		> If you want to reterive the data, you should create a new Volume from the SNAPSHOT, then attch to instances
		> SNAPSHOT are very cheap in price, as they are stored in S3, but we cannot see it in S3
		> NOTE : S3 is a maanged service by aws, so we get out of the box High Availability & Fault Tolerance
		
EBS LAB(Additional volume attached to instace ):
-------
Lunch an instance with ebs ROOT Volume
Create a new volume in the same region as the instance beacause we can't add the ebs volume present in the other region to the instance.
-To know about the storage attach to a volume use the command in cli > lsblk
to know about the storage details in the instace label use > df -h
attach the volume to the instace by clicking the action tab the attch volume--chooce the instace 
                                                                            -- choose the folder /dev/xvdf
In order to make new file format- sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
To make a directory in the root- sudo mkdir /add-data
To attach additional storage and transfer add-data file to instance lavel--sudo mount /dev/xvdf /add-data/
To make file in side the add-data folder: cd /add-data/
To remove additional storage from the instance : sudo umount /dev/xvdf and detached from GUI also 
To transfer additional data from one zone to other zone
          - Umount and detanced volume from the instance 
		  - take a snap shot of that additionalo volume.
		  - from snapshot action buttom create a volume, there we need to chhosed the same zone as per the instance zone
To transfer same data from one region to anopther region
         - Got to the snapshot then from action buttom copy the snapshopt to the required region. then createa new volume and attach to to the instace in the new region
-----------------------------------
EFS(ELASTIC FILE SYSTEM)
----------------------------------
> We can share the same EFS Storage to multiple instances

	> We Can attach the EFS Storage to an instance, which is located in a different Availability Zone

	> EFS Storage Scalable upto PB's

	> EFS is dynamic, we don't need to select any size, EFS automatically Scales Up and Down, as we add and remove the files

	> EFS is fully managed by AWS

	> EFS cannot be used as ROOT Volume, can only be ADDITIONAL DATA

	> EFS is highly priced

	> Unlike EBS, when we use EFS, it needs NFS protocol to work

		> NFS port - 2049

		> NOTE : NFS port is not for instances, it's for EFS storage
EFS LAB(Elastic file system attach to instance ):
Create a efs storage in the across zone from the efs resources
-when you attach that efs,it will provide a link
- attch the security group(port-2049) to efs file by clicking in the network tab.
- inorder to attach the volume go the git bash then run the command given by AWS console.
